Project:
Schedule Creator

Description:
Schedule Creator is a web based piece of software that will store and generate schedules for employers. Allowing employers to start a database of employees and generate schedules based on those employees.

To run:
www.schedulecreator.net
username - joe
password - eatatjoes

Once logged in you can navigate the menues on the left side of the screen.
The "Info" tab will display the employee information.
The "Schedules" tab will display the schedule screen.
The "messages" tab, as of right now will display the pseudo-code for our schedule generation algorithm.
The "Logout" tab will log you and return to the login screen.


Responses to feedback:
The one piece of feedback that may be implemented is when viewing a schedule to highlight or color only the logged in employee as opposed to our idea of coloring each employee with a unique color and highlighting them all.
This will make for a better "at a glance" look at the schedules.
